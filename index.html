<q>One small positive thought can change your whole day.</q>
<blockquote>Positive anything is better than negative nothing.Believe you can and youâ€™re halfway there.Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.urn every life situation into a positive one.our positive action combined with positive thinking results in success.There is no path to happiness; happiness is the path.Don't worry Be happy.They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: Someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.
